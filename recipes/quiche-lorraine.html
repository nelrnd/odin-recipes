    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Quiche Lorraine is a <strong>French</strong> tart with a filling made of cream, eggs, and bacon or ham, in an open pastry case. It was little known outside the French region of Lorraine until the mid-20th century.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p><em>For 6 servings:</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li>12 slices of bacon</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded Swiss cheese</li>
      <li>⅓ cup minced onion</li>
      <li>1 (9 inch) prepared pie crust</li>
      <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>2 cups light cream</li>
      <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon white sugar</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels, then chop coarsely. Sprinkle bacon, Swiss cheese, and onion into pastry shell.</li>
      <li>Whisk together eggs, cream, salt, sugar, and cayenne pepper in a medium bowl. Pour mixture into pastry shell.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) and continue baking until a knife inserted 1 inch from the edge comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Allow quiche to sit 10 minutes before cutting into wedges.</li>
    </ol>
